Project Flora Data Mining

Plants species can be found with the help of traits, by a book called Flora. These Flora's are digitalized with XML to make this process easier.
To find correlations between the different feature types in in Flora of the Guianas, a matrix must be developed with species on one axis and the relevant features on the other axis. All terms will be parsed with the help of Python and ordered in a text file.
